So it has been an interesting journey to say the least. I have been down a few different paths now. From warehouse worker, to college, to a full blown electrician. Nothing really felt right, or I just down right hated it if I am being honest.  After my wife joined the Navy, I kind of fell into limbo and stopped pursuing career paths. I was very discouraged and defeated to the point where I thought I was just going to work at some job I hated for the rest of my life. Then, someone at my current job had mentioned that they were doing a little coding on the side and that it was super easy learn with all the resources out there right now. So I started to do some research and was instantly intrigued. I listened to a lot of podcasts (shout out to CodeNewbie) and read a lot of blogs and was amazed by all the possibilities. Then, I started to do some free courses online in Javascript and immediately fell in love. The programmatic way of thinking just made sense to me. After making it part of the way through the free course I was taking, I realized I needed some more structure and direction. So I started to look into schools and bootcamps, and remembered the story I heard on a podcast (once again thanks CodeNewbie) of people going through Flatiron. After doing some extensive research, I came to realize the Flatiron was the place I was supposed to be and coding was my passion.
